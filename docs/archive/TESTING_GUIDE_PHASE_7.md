## ✅ Balance Updates - Phase 7.1 COMPLETE

### Balance Integration Status
**Phase 7.1 Implementation:** ✅ Complete (2026-02-05)

**Current Behavior:**
- Creating transaction → balance AUTOMATICALLY updated by TransactionStore
- Updating transaction → balance RECALCULATED by BalanceCoordinator
- Deleting transaction → balance ADJUSTED by BalanceCoordinator
- Console shows: `✅ [TransactionStore] Added/Updated/Deleted: ...` (no more warnings)

**What Changed:**
- TransactionStore now has `balanceCoordinator` dependency
- All CRUD operations call `updateBalances(for:)` after success
- `TransactionEvent.affectedAccounts` identifies which accounts to update
- Asynchronous recalculation via `balanceCoordinator.recalculateAccounts()`

**Verification:**
- After creating transaction → check account balance updates
- After editing amount → verify balance recalculates correctly
- After deleting → verify balance adjusts (amount removed)
- Check that multiple accounts update for transfers
